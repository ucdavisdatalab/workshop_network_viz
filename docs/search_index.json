Network data are relational… humans to humans. Animals to plants. 1.0.2 Features of a network Node/vertex Multi-mode Attributes Edge/connection directed/undirecied Multi-plex Attributes Levels 1.0.3 Network statistics Network-level statistics * Size * Density * Centralization * Transitivity * Degree distribution Actor-level * Centrality (degree, betweenness, eigenvector, etc.) 1.0.4 Storing network data Edge lists are columns of data, whereby the positioning of two nodes next to one another in a column indicates a connection. In a one-mode undirected network, the position of names in the columns have little meaning (A &lt;-&gt; B = B &lt;-&gt; A).In a one-mode directed network, however, the columns take on a meaning, where the first column is a list of names from which a connection originated (e.g. ‘from’), and the second column is a list of names to whom the connection is made (e.g. ‘to’). In these cases, A -&gt; B != B -&gt; A. In two-made networks, where nodes of mode 1 can only connect to nodes of mode 2, but not one another, each column will represent a mode. Matrices are the graph form for storing relational data. All edge lists end up as matrices because networks are matrices. The differences we pointed out in edge lists (directed/undirected, one-mode/two-mode) are reflected in the shape and symmetry of the matrix. Undirected one-mode: square and symmetrical Directed one-mode: square and asymmetrical Two-mode: rectangular and symmetrical Generally in network analysis we also want to have node attributes: Charactersitics of our nodes that can help us understand the data better… "],["data.html", "2 Data 2.1 Network descriptives", " 2 Data 2.0.1 About Delta Science Tracker We are using publicly available data from the Delta Stewardship Council’s (DSC) Delta Science Tracker. This database is a library of Delta-related research over the last 50 years. As the DSC’s website explains: “The Delta Science Tracker is a tool to improve coordination and collaboration of science activities in a way that is valuable to scientists, decision-makers, and managers in the Delta. The Delta Science Tracker allows users to explore and visualize recent research and monitoring efforts through the lenses of science activities, organizations, and people. It is intended to promote communication, create opportunities for collaboration, and enhance transparency for science funding opportunities and decisions.” The data we’ll use was downloaded from the DSC’s visualizations page, with the collaborations by organizations filter. Additional data was downloaded through scraping their webpage, which we did with permission from the DSC. Code for scraping their webpage can be found here. 2.0.2 Data descriptions Before we get into visualizations, we want to take a look at the data we have available. What relationships do we have? And what node or edge attributes are available? The relational data we will begin with is a two-mode edge list. edges &lt;- read.csv(&#39;data/edgelist_twomode.csv&#39;) head(edges) ## project_id org_name ## 1 50122 Agricultural Coalitions:... ## 2 50122 SJCDWQC ## 3 49780 Anchor QEA ## 4 49780 SFSU ## 5 49780 USFWS ## 6 49780 DWR nodes &lt;- read.csv(&#39;data/nodelist_twomode.csv&#39;) head(nodes) ## name proj_name mode startdate enddate ## 1 50122 SJCDWQC Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring 1 2008 2019 ## 2 50122 SJCDWQC Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring 1 2008 2019 ## 3 50122 SJCDWQC Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring 1 2008 2019 ## 4 50122 SJCDWQC Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring 1 2008 2019 ## 5 50122 SJCDWQC Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring 1 2008 2019 ## 6 50122 SJCDWQC Groundwater Quality Trend Monitoring 1 2008 2019 ## funds n_years sci_theme mgmt_theme ## 1 $0 12 Environmental conditions Water quality ## 2 $0 12 Environmental conditions Water supply management ## 3 $0 12 Habitat changes Water quality ## 4 $0 12 Habitat changes Water supply management ## 5 $0 12 Land use and human activities Water quality ## 6 $0 12 Land use and human activities Water supply management ## url ## 1 https://sciencetracker.deltacouncil.ca.gov/node/50122 ## 2 https://sciencetracker.deltacouncil.ca.gov/node/50122 ## 3 https://sciencetracker.deltacouncil.ca.gov/node/50122 ## 4 https://sciencetracker.deltacouncil.ca.gov/node/50122 ## 5 https://sciencetracker.deltacouncil.ca.gov/node/50122 ## 6 https://sciencetracker.deltacouncil.ca.gov/node/50122 tail(nodes) ## name proj_name mode startdate enddate funds n_years ## 627 NPS &lt;NA&gt; 2 NA NA &lt;NA&gt; NA ## 628 Pacific Flyway Council &lt;NA&gt; 2 NA NA &lt;NA&gt; NA ## 629 UBC &lt;NA&gt; 2 NA NA &lt;NA&gt; NA ## 630 Oregon State University &lt;NA&gt; 2 NA NA &lt;NA&gt; NA ## 631 Woodland-Davis Clean Wat... &lt;NA&gt; 2 NA NA &lt;NA&gt; NA ## 632 University of Kansas &lt;NA&gt; 2 NA NA &lt;NA&gt; NA ## sci_theme mgmt_theme url ## 627 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 628 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 629 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 630 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 631 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 632 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 2.0.3 What story do we want to tell?
