# Two-mode visualization

* What actors have been most active across projects? 
* Are most-active members typically leaders or contributors? (make subgraphs based on edge attribute + make multiple plots with fixed coordinates)
* What actors have been most active on climate-related projects? (Node attribute of project node)

We can use the same approaches as with one mode... but we shouldn't because mode one and two are just not comparable.
